👋 Hi, I’m Omkar Pawar
Data Analyst | Python • SQL • Power BI • Excel

I’m a BCA graduate focused on data analysis and business insights, not buzzwords.
I work with real datasets to answer practical questions like what’s selling, what’s stuck, who matters, and where money is leaking.

I care more about clarity, accuracy, and decision-making than fancy visuals.

🧠 What I Actually Do Well

Clean messy datasets and make them usable

Write SQL queries that answer business questions (not just SELECT *)

Analyze data using Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

Build Power BI dashboards with meaningful KPIs

Translate data into clear business insights

No fake “AI expert” claims. No shallow dashboards.

🛠️ Skills

Data Cleaning & Validation

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

📊 Projects (What You’ll Find Here)
🔹 Sales & Profitability Analysis

Identified top-performing states, products, and channels

Analyzed profit margin vs revenue traps

Built dashboards answering:

What is selling?

What is stuck in inventory?

Which customers matter?

Where is profit leaking?

🔹 Business KPI Dashboards

Revenue, Profit, AOV, Growth %

Month-over-Month & Channel-wise comparisons

Clean layout focused on decision-making, not decoration

🔹 Data Cleaning & Validation

Duplicate detection

Null handling

Schema understanding (PK/FK logic)

Dataset readiness for BI tools

📌 How I Think (Important)

Data without context is useless

A chart without a question is noise

If a KPI can’t drive action, it doesn’t belong on a dashboard

If I can’t explain an insight in simple language, I don’t trust it.

🎯 What I’m Working Towards

Stronger SQL problem solving

Advanced Power BI DAX

Better business storytelling

Industry-level data projects (sales, finance, operations)
